<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Model View Controller pattern was invented in a Smalltalk context for decoupling 
  the graphical interface of an application from the code that actually does the 
  work. It turned out to be an very important idea that affected how much Smalltalk 
  code was built and is applicable to other object-oriented languages as well. 
</p>
<h2>The Model</h2>
<p>In MVC the model is the code that carries out some task. It is built with no 
  necessary concern for how it will "look and feel" when presented to 
  the user. It has a purely functional interface, meaning that it has a set of 
  public functions that can be used to achieve all of its functionality. Some 
  of the functions are query methods that permit a "user" to get information 
  about the current state of the model. Others are mutator methods that permit 
  the state to be modified. </p>
<p>However, a model must be able to "register" views and it must be 
  able to "notify" all of its registered views when any of its functions 
  cause its state to be changed. </p>
<p>In Java a Model consists of one or more classes that extend the class java.util.Observable. 
  This superclass will provide the register/notify infrastructure needed to support 
  a set of views. </p>
<h2>Many Views</h2>
<p>A model in MVC can have several views. Two examples are the rows and columns 
  view of a spreadsheet and the pie chart view of some column in the same spreadsheet. 
  A view provides graphical user interface (GUI) components for a model. It gets 
  the values that it displays by querying the model of which it is a view. </p>
<p>When a user manipulates a view of a model, the view informs a controller of 
  the desired change. </p>
<p>In Java the views are built of AWT or SWING components. However, views must 
  implement the java.util.Observer interface. </p>
<h2>Many Controllers</h2>
<p>Views in MVC are associated with controllers that update the model as necessary 
  when a user interacts with an associated view. The controller can call mutator 
  methods of the model to get it to update its state. Of course, then the model 
  will notify ALL registered views that a change has been made and so they will 
  update what they display to the user as appropriate. </p>
<p>In Java the controllers are the listeners in the Java event structure. </p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>First you write a Model that extends java.util.Observable. You give your class 
  accessors to get informtion about its current state and you write mutators to 
  update the state. Each mutator should call setChanged() and one or the other 
  of notifyObsvers() after it has actually changed the state. NotifyObservers 
  will send an update message to each registered observer (View). There are versions 
  of notifyObservers that let you pass additional information about the change 
  as well. </p>
<p>Then you can create one or more views. Each view must implement the java.util.Observer 
  interface and hence implement the update method. The Object in the second parameter 
  will be used to receive additional information if passed. </p>
<pre><font color="blue">interface Observer
{	void update(Observable t, Object o);	
}</font></pre>
<p>The View should implement the update method by querying the model (actually 
  the Observable t) for the changes it needs and then make appropriate changes 
  to the view itself. </p>
<p>The View also needs to register with the Model it wishes to observe by sending 
  the model the addObserver message. The Model will remember all registered views 
  so that it can notify (update) them later. </p>
<p>The reason that a Model has to extend java.util.Observable is that the Observable 
  class provides all of the register/notify infrastructure needed by a model, 
  so you don't have to build any of this and can concentrate on the functionality 
  of your application. </p>
<p>A model can have several views. MVC was created specifically to permit this. 
  Also, a view can register with several models and get updates from each of them. 
</p>
<p>It isn't necessary to build your Model so that it is a single Observable. Instead, 
  several parts of the model can be separately Observable, each part with its 
  own Observers. </p>
<h2>An Example Model--Temperature</h2>
<p>Here is a model that is actually too simple to really be built as a class. 
  It encapsulates the notion of a temperature in either Farenheit or Celsius units. 
  When we create a temperature object it is at the freezing point of water but 
  we can ask for its value in either type of unit and we can likewise set its 
  value using either kind of unit. Notice that there are no GUI elements here, 
  but there is some infrastructure, namely the setChanged and notifyObserver calls 
  in the mutators. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">public class TemperatureModel extends java.util.Observable
{	public double getF(){return temperatureF;}
	
	public double getC(){return (temperatureF - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0;}
	
	public void setF(double tempF)
	{	temperatureF = tempF;
		setChanged();
		notifyObservers();
	}
	
	public void setC(double tempC)
	{	temperatureF = tempC*9.0/5.0 + 32.0;
		setChanged();
		notifyObservers();
	}

	private double temperatureF = 32.0;
}
 </font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that it is especially interesting, but you can set a Farenheit temperature 
  and then get the equivalent Celsius temperature. Thus this acts as a temperature 
  converter as well as a temperature. </p>
<h2>An Example GUI for the Temperature Model</h2>
<p>Here is a simple GUI for this model.We want a simple textual view of the temperature 
  along with two buttons, one to increase and the other to decrease the temperature 
  by one degree. The user can also put a number into the text field and hit the 
  "Enter" key. We can actually have two different GUIs with these properties, 
  one for Farenheit and the other for Celsius temperatures. Each one alone will 
  be pretty boring since when we hit the Raise button the number in the view just 
  increases by one. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="mvcgui_files/singlegui.jpg" width="209" height="110"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets interesting, though, if we have two different views, one for Farenheit 
  and the other for Celsius, simultaneously attached to the model. Then, when 
  you manipulate either of them, the other is also automatically updated. Here 
  is an example. I've clicked Raise on the Farenheit view a couple of times. It 
  is important to note that these are separate GUIs. Also, both are connected 
  to the same model. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="mvcgui_files/textgui.jpg" width="210" height="223"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since these two GUIs are so similar, they are built as subclasses of a general 
  TemperatureGUI class. This has all of the functionality, but has no listeners 
  for its buttons and field. It also doesn't implement the required update method 
  of the Observer class. It is therefore abstract. These will all be supplied 
  by subclasses. </p>
<p>Note the key statement below that connects this view to the model. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">abstract class TemperatureGUI implements java.util.Observer
{	TemperatureGUI(String label, TemperatureModel model, int h, int v)
	{	this.label = label;
		this.model = model;
		temperatureFrame = new Frame(label);
		temperatureFrame.add("North", new Label(label));
		temperatureFrame.add("Center", display);
		Panel buttons = new Panel();
		buttons.add(upButton);
		buttons.add(downButton);		
		temperatureFrame.add("South", buttons);		
		temperatureFrame.addWindowListener(new CloseListener());	
		model.addObserver(this); <font color="red">// Connect the View to the Model</font>
		temperatureFrame.setSize(200,100);
		temperatureFrame.setLocation(h, v);
		temperatureFrame.setVisible(true);
	}
	
	public void setDisplay(String s){ display.setText(s);}
	
	public double getDisplay()
	{	double result = 0.0;
		try
		{	result = Double.valueOf(display.getText()).doubleValue();
		}
		catch (NumberFormatException e){}
		return result;
	}
	
	public void addDisplayListener(ActionListener a){ display.addActionListener(a);}
	public void addUpListener(ActionListener a){ upButton.addActionListener(a);}
	public void addDownListener(ActionListener a){ downButton.addActionListener(a);}
	
	protected TemperatureModel model(){return model;}
	
	private String label;
	private TemperatureModel model;
	private Frame temperatureFrame;
	private TextField display = new TextField();
	private Button upButton = new Button("Raise");
	private Button downButton = new Button("Lower");
	
	public static class CloseListener extends WindowAdapter
	{	public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e)
		{	e.getWindow().setVisible(false);
			System.exit(0);
		}
	}
}</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that it does have methods for adding listeners to the three components.</p>
<p>The Farenheit GUI follows. It defines listeners and adds them to its components 
  using the addlistener methods defined in the superclass. It also supplies the 
  update method. The Celsius one is similar. Its only difference is that it uses 
  getC and setC instead of getF and setF.</p>
<p>The key to this is the update method of the Observer interface. This is called 
  by the model when it executes the notifyObservers method. Each registered observer 
  is sent an update message. The view responds by querying the model for changed 
  information and then updating itself accordingly. Here we get the new temperature 
  in the desired units and set the display accordingly. </p>
<p>The action listeners also update the model by calling its mutators. This lets 
  the user, who sees the view, manipulate the model itself. Note, however, that 
  the listeners don't update the view's display. Instead they wait for the update 
  message that they know will be sent by the newly changed model. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">class FarenheitGUI extends TemperatureGUI
{	public FarenheitGUI(TemperatureModel model, int h, int v)
	{	super("Farenheit Temperature", model, h, v);
		setDisplay(""+model.getF());
		addUpListener(new UpListener());
		addDownListener(new DownListener());
		addDisplayListener(new DisplayListener());
	}
	
	public void update(Observable t, Object o) <font color="red">// Called from the Model</font>
	{	setDisplay("" + model().getF());
	}
	
	class UpListener implements ActionListener
	{	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
		{	model().setF(model().getF() + 1.0);
		}
	}
	
	class DownListener implements ActionListener
	{	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
		{	model().setF(model().getF() - 1.0);
		}
	}
	
	class DisplayListener implements ActionListener
	{	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)
		{	double value = getDisplay();
			model().setF(value);
		}
	}
}</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to notice that the view does not hold any information internally 
  about the current temperature in the model. This way it is never "out of 
  date." It can always get the current temperature by querying the model. 
</p>
<h2>The Main Driver</h2>
<p>Here is a class that can be used to create the two views shown above.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><font color="blue">public class MVCTempConvert 
{	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{	TemperatureModel temperature = new TemperatureModel();
		new FarenheitGUI(temperature, 100, 100);
		new CelsiusGUI(temperature,100, 250);
	}
}
</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Further Extensions--A Graphical GUI</h2>
<p>We can create an entirely different view. Here is one that looks like a temperature 
  gauge. This one has no controller and so is completely passive. An ambitious 
  student might add mouse actions to let us drag the top of the red bar up and 
  down. We show this GUI along with one each of the ones defined above. When the 
  user manipulates either of the text views the model is changed and all three 
  views are notified and so update what we see on the screen. As you click either 
  of the Lower buttons the red bar gets shorter, but by different amounts for 
  the two Lower buttons. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, providing this view requires no modification to the Model code or to 
  other views. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">class TemperatureCanvas extends Canvas
{	public TemperatureCanvas(TemperatureGauge farenheit)
	{	_farenheit = farenheit;
	}
	
	public void paint(Graphics g)
	{	g.setColor(Color.black);
		g.drawRect(left,top, width, height);
		g.setColor(Color.red);
		g.fillOval(left-width/2, top+height-width/3,width*2, width*2);
		g.setColor(Color.black);
		g.drawOval(left-width/2, top+height-width/3,width*2, width*2);

		long redtop = height*(_farenheit.get()-_farenheit.getMax())/(_farenheit.getMin()-_farenheit.getMax());

	}
	
	private TemperatureGauge _farenheit;

<h2>One More Observer</h2>
<p>Graham Perkins of DeMontfort University (Milton Keynes, GB) suggested a slider 
  GUI for this application. Actually, he gave me one that was integrated into 
  his own framework. I built this one more compatible with what is here. </p>
<p>A slider is just a java.awt.Scrollbar. We can connect it to our model as an 
  observer and can use an AdjustmentListener to update the model itself. The slider 
  can be manipulated by the user to change all the other views, and when any of 
  the other views is used to manipulate the model, the slider moves automatically 
  to the relative position along its scale. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">public class SliderGUI implements Observer
{	public SliderGUI(TemperatureModel m, int h, int v)
	{	m.addObserver(this); <font color="red">//Observe the temperature model</font>
		model = m;
		sliderFrame.add(tempControl);
		tempControl.addAdjustmentListener(new SlideListener());
		sliderFrame.setSize(250,50);
		sliderFrame.setLocation(h, v);
		sliderFrame.setVisible(true);
		sliderFrame.addWindowListener(new TemperatureGUI.CloseListener());		
	}
	
	public void update(Observable t, Object o)
	{	double temp = ((TemperatureModel)t).getC();
		tempControl.setValue((int)temp); <font color="red">// Move the slider thumb</font>
	}
	
	class SlideListener implements AdjustmentListener
	{	public void adjustmentValueChanged(AdjustmentEvent e)
		{	model.setC(tempControl.getValue());
		}
	}
	
	private Scrollbar tempControl = new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 0, 10, -50, 160);
	private TemperatureModel model = null;
	private Frame sliderFrame = new Frame("Celsius");
}

<img src="mvcgui_files/gauge.jpg" width="494" height="372">
</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have dragged the thumb of the slider to the middle and all the views 
  updated. Notice that this view gives no feedback other than the position of 
  the thumb. Also notice the most important thing, that these views all interact, 
  but make no reference to each other. They all work because they have registered 
  with the underlying model and take updates from it when any of them modify the 
  model. </p>
<p><font color="blue"><br>
  </font></p>
<h2>Notes for Educators</h2>
<p>I would not use the Temperature Model early in a course as it has no interest 
  as an object in itself. To use Viera Proulx and Richard Rasala's terminology, 
  it isn't an "Object that Matters." I would introduce it as a simple 
  model later in the course when I want to introduce MVC and foucs on the complexities 
  of that while having a trivially simple model to work with. </p>
<p>One sensible way to run a course is to avoid GUI stuff at the beginning and 
  do it later in the term. It helps if you have developed several models in the 
  beginning of the course that can be given GUIs later. If you give them complete 
  functional interfaces you will be able to easily add GUIs using MVC. If you 
  do this you will have a way to emphasize the clear separation between the application 
  code and its GUI, since you use the model unaltered except for the notify calls. 
  A calculator is a good example of this. A non-GUI calculator is interesting 
  and emphasizes object-oriented concepts if correctly built. There are lots of 
  objects and some of them are not singletons. The design is simple enough for 
  first year students. And yet it benefits greatly from a GUI. It is also advantageous 
  to build the model completely separately from the GUI both to emphasize the 
  correct separation and to give the students a more manageable problem in each 
  part. </p>
<p>The difference between the Farenheit GUI and the Celsisus GUI is so small that 
  it is best handled with a Strategy Pattern. Then you only need to write one 
  Temperature GUI class and specialize it with a Farenheit Strategy, etc. Here 
  is an interface for the strategy and the Celsius Strategy itself. The strategy 
  is used within the listeners. I leave the rest as an exercise. The slider GUI 
  could benefit especially from using such a strategy, since then it could be 
  used for other applications altogether unrelated to temperature. </p>
<blockquote>   <pre><font color="blue">interface ValueStrategy
{	public void set(double d);
	public double get();
}</font></pre>
  <pre><font color="blue">class CelsiusStrategy implements ValueStrategy
{	public CelsiusStrategy(TemperatureModel m) {model = m;}
	public void set(double d){model.setC(d);}
	public double get(){ return model.getC();}
	
	private TemperatureModel model;
}</font></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One can also note that the Java event structure is very similar to MVC. The 
  listeners register with the components (addActionListener...) and are notified 
  when the state of the component changes (button pushed). The structure of the 
  Java Swing components is even more similar to MVC, since Swing was built with 
  MVC in mind. Thus, teaching something like the above can be an important introduction 
  to Swing. </p>
<p>The event structure here is discussed in <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/%7Ebergin/patterns/event.html">Java 
  Event Patterns</a>.</p>
<p>The strategy pattern is disucssed in <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/%7Ebergin/patterns/strategydecorator.html">Strategy, 
  Decorator, and Composite Patterns</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a page with an <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/%7Ebergin/mvc/temperature.html">Applet version of this code</a>. 
  You may be able to run it, depending on the capabilities of your browser. </p>
<p>Alternatively you might be able to save the above link (an html file) and the 
  required <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/%7Ebergin/mvc/mvc.jar">mvc.jar</a> file. 
  You could then run it with the Appletviewer. </p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://csis.pace.edu/%7Ebergin/mvc/run/index.html">another version</a> in which you can create 
  as many GUIs of each kind as you like. </p>

<h2>Acknowledgements </h2>
<p>Michael Suesserott from Germany corrected my spelling. Thanks. I was so careful 
  to spell Farenheit and Celsius correctly that I didn't notice that I had spelled 
  gauge as "guage." Oh well. Graham Perkins suggested the SliderGUI 
  as noted above. </p>
